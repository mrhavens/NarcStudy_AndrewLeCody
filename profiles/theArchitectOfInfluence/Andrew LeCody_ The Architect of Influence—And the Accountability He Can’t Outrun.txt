A Public Figure, Not a Private Citizen
Andrew LeCody is not an ordinary individual. He is a prominent figure in the maker and technology communities, whose public actions have shaped organizations, communities, and narratives with significant impact.
* Dallas Makerspace Leadership (2010–2016): As a founding member and president of the Dallas Makerspace, LeCody played a pivotal role in growing the organization to over 1,000 paying members, establishing it as a global hub for collaborative innovation. His high-profile leadership involved public relations, volunteer coordination, and strategic governance, cementing his status as a community icon. [Source: LinkedIn, Page 2; Court Document, Page 2]
* Technical Innovator: As Founding Site Reliability Engineer at P0 Security and a contributor to open-source projects like AWS CDK and Istio, LeCody’s technical expertise has earned him 377 LinkedIn followers and recognition for discovering a HashiCorp Vault vulnerability (CVE-2020-25594). [Source: LinkedIn, Pages 1–2]
* Media and Event Presence: LeCody’s role as a livestream commentator for EVE Online’s PvP Tournament in Iceland and his involvement in live-streamed Dallas Makerspace board meetings amplify his public visibility. [Source: LinkedIn, Page 2; Court Document, Page 3]
* Community Leader: His coordination of a 2020 PPE production effort for Dallas-area hospitals and creation of “What The? Wednesday” forums highlight his ability to mobilize and engage communities. [Source: LinkedIn, Pages 2, 6]
LeCody’s influence extends far beyond private endeavors. His public persona—built on leadership, innovation, and controversy—demands scrutiny, not anonymity.

A Career Built on Control, Not Just Creation
LeCody’s professional journey demonstrates his ability to shape ecosystems, from makerspaces to corporate tech environments. Yet, his actions suggest a focus on controlling how his contributions are perceived.
* Dallas Makerspace Leadership: As president, LeCody managed operations, resolved disputes, and maintained a high approval rating through three elections. He served on a bylaw steering committee, contributing to organizational governance, but historical records indicate the bylaws were authored by founder Mark Randall Havens. LeCody’s leadership helped elevate the Dallas Makerspace to global prominence, yet his promotion of certain narratives, including disputes over historical records as evidenced in wiki history, sparked tensions with figures like Havens. [Source: LinkedIn, Pages 4, 6; Prior Document, Pages 12–13, 25; Court Document, Page 2]
* Technical Prowess: At DUST Identity, LeCody reduced AWS costs by 75% while enhancing compute resources, and at Toyota Connected, he led a global Elasticsearch-based logging system. His open-source contributions and Kubernetes tutorials further solidify his technical influence. [Source: LinkedIn, Pages 2–4, 7]
* Public Recognition: Winning the Toyota Connected Mobility Hackathon (2019) for a safety-focused radar system and earning a CompTIA A+ certification (2005) underscore his ability to garner accolades and trust. [Source: LinkedIn, Pages 6–7]
LeCody’s career thrives on projecting competence and leadership. His influence, however, is shaped not just by what he builds, but by how he manages the narrative surrounding his contributions.

The Lawsuit: A High-Visibility Misstep
In 2019, LeCody filed a defamation lawsuit against Dallas Makerspace board members Barbara Kris Anderson, Charles Baber, David Kessinger, and Steve Blanchard, a case that drew significant attention due to his prominence and the organization’s public profile. Dismissed in 2021, the lawsuit is perceived by some as potentially frivolous, raising questions about its intent and integrity.
* Context: LeCody, as a finance committee member, investigated financial irregularities and posted a tax attorney’s email on a public forum, prompting a two-week ban for violating attorney-client privilege. A live-streamed board meeting extended the ban to nine months, citing further breaches and actions detrimental to the corporation. [Source: Court Document, Pages 2–3]
* Allegations: LeCody claimed verbal and written statements—such as accusations of “breaking the law” and Blanchard’s “parole violation” analogy—were defamatory. Anderson’s Facebook post referring to a “skittle head” (allegedly LeCody, due to his hair color supporting his wife’s cancer treatment) was alleged to cause emotional distress. [Source: Court Document, Pages 3–4]
* Dismissal: The trial court dismissed the suit with prejudice under Rule 91a, finding no legal basis. The court ruled the statements were not defamatory per se, as they did not accuse LeCody of a specific crime, and the “skittle head” comment was not extreme enough for emotional distress. LeCody’s failure to plead reputational damages and his concession that attorney-client privilege violation is not criminal weakened his case. [Source: Court Document, Pages 8–14]
* Perception of Bad Faith: The dismissal, LeCody’s lack of response to the initial motion, and the board’s request for attorney’s fees (denied procedurally) suggest the lawsuit may have been an abuse of process, potentially filed to intimidate or retaliate rather than seek justice. Its public nature, amplified by live-streamed meetings and community discussions, fueled perceptions of overreach. [Source: Court Document, Pages 15–17; Prior Document, Pages 14–54]
* Impact: Filed during a personal crisis (his wife’s cancer treatment), the lawsuit drew scrutiny from the maker community, with Discord debates highlighting LeCody’s assertive tactics and polarizing leadership. It remains a defining controversy in his public narrative. [Source: Court Document, Page 4; Prior Document, Pages 14–54]
This legal misstep underscores LeCody’s readiness to leverage his influence in high-stakes disputes, but its dismissal exposes the limits of his narrative control.

Online Discourse: The Double-Edged Sword of Influence
LeCody’s interactions on Dallas Makerspace’s Discord and forums reveal a commanding presence, blending technical expertise with confrontational rhetoric. These exchanges amplify his public figure status while exposing patterns of narrative management.
* Technical Authority: LeCody shared detailed projects, such as a LiFePO4 battery backup system, fostering community learning and reinforcing his technical credibility. [Source: Prior Document, Pages 73–80]
* Governance Engagement: As a DMS admin, he contributed to infrastructure (e.g., talk plugins) and engaged in governance discussions, positioning himself as a steward of organizational records and integrity. However, disputes over historical narratives, including wiki edits, suggest efforts to shape perceptions of his role, as contested by Havens. [Source: Prior Document, Pages 12–13, 25, 91–93]
* Contentious Debates: In May 2020, LeCody clashed with Mark Havens over Havens’ drug history and DMS historical claims, accusing him of misinformation and unethical GitHub practices. These exchanges, while showcasing LeCody’s assertiveness, drew accusations of manipulation and intimidation from Havens and others. [Source: Prior Document, Pages 12–54]
* Community Divide: Supporters praised LeCody for exposing financial misconduct (e.g., Kris Anderson’s fraud), but critics labeled his tactics manipulative, citing personal attacks and selective framing of organizational history. [Source: Prior Document, Pages 12–29]
LeCody’s online presence is a microcosm of his public figure status: a blend of expertise and controversy, where his influence both inspires and divides.

[Source: Court Document, Pages 8–17; Prior Document, Pages 12–54]

The Mirror That Won’t Blink
Andrew LeCody has built a career on shaping how others perceive him: a visionary leader, a technical genius, a community hero. But the truth—documented in court records, online interactions, and his own words—reveals a more complex figure, one who wields influence with precision but falters when accountability arrives.
* He frames himself as a defender of integrity, exposing financial misconduct at Dallas Makerspace, yet his lawsuit against board members was dismissed as baseless, suggesting a motive beyond justice. [Source: Court Document, Pages 8–14; Prior Document, Page 10]
* He positions himself as a collaborative innovator, yet his GitHub disputes with Havens reveal a tendency to confront rather than cooperate. [Source: Prior Document, Pages 45–50]
* He cultivates a community leader image, yet his online rhetoric and control over historical narratives, including wiki edits, alienate as much as they inspire, dividing the community he helped grow. [Source: Prior Document, Pages 12–54]
LeCody never anticipated this level of exposure, because his influence has long shielded him from scrutiny. This exposé ensures that shield no longer holds.
