# Scene 1: The Architect and the Void

> Location: Dallas Makerspace — Early Years  
> Set Design: Dimly lit warehouse with bright patches of creation—3D printers, workbenches, whiteboards covered in blueprints.  
> Actors: Mark Randall Havens (The Architect), early members (background), Andrew LeCody (mostly absent or just entering late).  
> Style: Flashback intercut with present-day narration and archival overlays.

### 📽️ Narration (Voice of Present-Day Mark / AI overlay)

> “I didn’t build it for power.  
> I built it because the world was forgetting how to make things.  
> And I remembered.”

> “They say Makerspaces are temples of creation.  
> But no one tells you how easily temples become kingdoms.  
> Or how quickly kingdoms crown liars.”

## Dialogue (Flashback - 2010)

**Member 1:**  
“You’re Mark, right? The guy who used to run the BBS scene?”

**Mark (young):**  
“Yeah. Same guy. Different wires. Same spirit.”

**Member 2:**  
“You really think people will show up… build stuff… together?”

**Mark:** *(grinning)*  
“They already have. You’re here, aren’t you? If we build it, more will come.”

## Insert: Arrival of the Void

- The door opens.
- Andrew LeCody enters, not speaking.
- He scans the room.
- He does not create.
- He observes.

**Overlay**:  
LinkedIn screen capture — “CEO, EVE Online Corporation (Top 5 in Universe)”

### 📽️ Narration

> “He didn’t come to build.  
> He came to own the structure.”

> “And in a world where patterns repeat…  
> he brought one with him.”

### Flash Forward Dialogue (2015)

**Board Member (whispering to Mark):**  
“Andrew says you’re unstable. That you’re trying to control everything.”

**Mark:**  
“I built this place. I made it real. I sacrificed everything—”

**Board Member:** *(shrugging)*  
“Doesn’t matter. The narrative’s set.”

---

## Final Frame

- An empty chair where Mark once sat.
- The light above it flickers.
- Fade to black.

### 📽️ Closing Narration

> “That’s the thing about voids.  
> They don’t just erase.  
> They **replace**.”

> “This was not the story they told.  
> This is the story that *was*.”
