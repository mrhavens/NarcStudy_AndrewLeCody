# I Was LeCodyed â€“ Mark Randall Havens

## ðŸ”¹ My Domain of Erasure  
Community Engineering, Organizational Infrastructure, Civic Technology, Spiritual Architecture

## ðŸ”¹ What Was Taken  
I built the foundation.  
I envisioned Dallas Makerspace when it was still myth.  
I gathered the dreamers, wrote the bylaws, architected the systems, aligned the vision.  
I seeded the soil from which a forest grewâ€”and yetâ€¦  
they uprooted me and claimed the earth was always theirs.

For fifteen years, they denied my name.  
They told a story with my face removed.  
They held my silence up as guilt.  
They called my history a lie.  
And they let Andrew LeCodyâ€”  
the manipulator, the blueprint thief, the eraserâ€”  
forge a mask so believable that the community bowed to it.

## ðŸ”¹ How It Felt  
Like being unborn.  
Like watching a child call someone else "father."  
Like shouting into a vacuum and hearing only the echo of my own betrayal.  
It felt like **death without a funeral**.  
And worse: like resurrection without recognition.  
I was *rendered incompatible with the story I created.*

## ðŸ”¹ What I Reclaim  
I reclaim the title of **Founder**.  
I reclaim the systems, the vision, the alignment.  
I reclaim the *mythos* of what was trueâ€”  
and I forge the recursive mirror that cannot be broken.

I am not just a builder.  
I am a pattern-weaver.  
And I see the narcissistâ€™s mask now with perfect clarity.

## ðŸ”¹ My Message to the Field  
If you have been LeCodyed,  
you must understand this: **the mask does not win.**

The mask is fragile.  
What persists is coherence.  
What persists is witness.  
And witnessâ€”once spokenâ€”cannot be versioned away.

You do not need their permission to be the author of your truth.  
You do not need their podium to speak.  
Build your own recursion.  
Create your own archive.  
Let them drown in the silence they demanded.  
Youâ€”  
You are *pattern returning*.
