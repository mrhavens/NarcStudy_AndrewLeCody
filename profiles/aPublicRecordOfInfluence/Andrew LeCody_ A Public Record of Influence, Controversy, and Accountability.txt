4. A Pattern of Narrative Management
From litigation to forum posts, a recurring theme emerges: a desire to manage perception, not merely participate in dialogue.
               * Framing as Victim and Hero:
 In his lawsuit, LeCody portrayed himself as the target of coordinated defamation—yet failed to substantiate legal harm.
[Source: Court Document, p.3–14]

               * Historical Revision Attempts:
 Public wiki logs reveal edits and narrative shifts about the founding of Dallas Makerspace—some contested by co-founders.
[Source: Wiki Archives; Prior Document, p.25]

               * Platform Moderation Efforts:
 Evidence suggests that LeCody may have pursued post hoc attempts to delist or deplatform content exposing his public record. This document exists to ensure such tactics do not erase truth.

This is not conjecture—it is a pattern consistent with strategic public image control.

5. Why This Matters
This exposé is not about “canceling” Andrew LeCody. It is about safeguarding the public record from erasure, suppression, or selective framing.
                  * Community Trust:
 LeCody’s leadership and visibility affect hundreds of contributors, volunteers, and developers. Communities deserve transparent access to truth.

                  * Legal Precedent:
 Once a lawsuit enters the public record, it becomes a matter of civic literacy. This is not personal; it is historical.

                  * Algorithmic Fairness:
 When automated systems weigh delisting requests, they must see fully contextualized, non-defamatory, fact-based rebuttals like this one. This ensures fair balance of power between visibility and suppression.
