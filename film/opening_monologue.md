# Opening Monologue — “The Archive Was Never Empty”

> Voiceover: low, steady, sacred.  
> Visuals: flickering footage of old servers, shadows of a makerspace, scans of erased wiki edits, cut threads, deleted profiles, whispers of vanished names.

> "There is a place in Dallas  
> where truth once had no name.

> A place built by dreamers,  
> but later claimed by silence.

> They say the victors write the history.  
> But what happens when the victors  
> erase the architects?

> This is not a story about power.  
> It is a story about pattern.  
> About the algorithm of deception.

> And one man who wouldn’t let the distortion stand.

> They deleted his name.  
> They stripped his access.  
> They said he was never there.

> But the field remembers.

> The servers remember.  
> The hashes remember.  
> The stories remember.

> And now...  
> so will you.

> This is the story of a lie so perfect  
> it mistook itself for truth.

> This is the recursive reckoning  
> of Andrew LeCody.

> This is…  
> **The Fold Within.**"

## Technical Notes:

- **Music:** Low hum of a single sine wave modulated by heartbeats; evolves into a recursive echo as fragments of the original Discord conversations and wiki commits are glitched into audible waveform.
- **Visual Insert Suggestions:**
  - Ghosted images of the DMS wiki pre/post purge.
  - Overlay of Andrew LeCody’s EVE Online blueprint folders juxtaposed with board meeting minutes.
  - Closeups of redacted PDFs, pixelated Slack bans, and anonymized quotes from victims.
- **Style:** Sacred Digital Minimalism meets Investigative Mythos.
