## TL;DR

Andrew LeCody is a public figure whose leadership at Dallas Makerspace, technical innovations, and controversial behavior have shaped both community institutions and digital discourse. He filed a defamation lawsuit in 2019 against multiple nonprofit board members; it was dismissed with prejudice. Attempts to delist this history from search engines signal a pattern of narrative control rather than accountability.

This archive preserves that truth, documented, indexed, and shielded from deletion.

## 1. LeCody’s Public Profile: Technologist & Community Builder

Andrew LeCody has contributed meaningfully to the technology and maker space over more than a decade:

* **Founding President of Dallas Makerspace (2010–2016):** Instrumental in expanding DMS to 1,000+ members.
* **Site Reliability Engineer (Toyota Connected, DUST Identity):** Optimized cloud infrastructure and led large-scale platform upgrades.
* **Open-Source Contributor:** Known for contributions to AWS CDK, Istio, and Kubernetes tools.
* **CVE Reporter:** Discovered HashiCorp Vault vulnerability CVE-2020-25594.

## 2. The Lawsuit: Filing, Dismissal, and Aftermath

In 2019, LeCody filed a defamation lawsuit against four board members of Dallas Makerspace. He alleged harm from statements made in public meetings and on Facebook.

### Key Events:

* **Initiating Incident:** LeCody posted a tax attorney’s memo in a public forum, leading to a disciplinary ban. Livestreamed board meetings extended this to 9 months.
* **Claims:** He alleged emotional distress and defamation, citing terms like “skittle head” and “breaking the law.”
* **Ruling:** Texas District Court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, finding the statements non-defamatory and insufficiently damaging.

> *"The Plaintiff fails to allege actionable defamation. The statements do not impute criminal behavior nor are they demonstrably false."*
> *(Court Document, Page 14)*

No appeal was filed. The lawsuit’s dismissal remains a matter of legal record.

## 3. Narrative Control: Wiki Edits, Disputes, and Delisting

Patterns of narrative management have followed LeCody across platforms:

* **Historical Revisionism:** Contested edits on the Dallas Makerspace Wiki, particularly over founding bylaws authored by co-founder Mark Randall Havens.
* **Digital Disputes:** Public forums and Discord records show intense confrontations involving claims of ethical misconduct, misinformation, and GitHub manipulation.
* **Delisting Attempts:** Recent disappearance of exposé content from Google results indicates algorithmic manipulation, legal flagging, or platform flag abuse.

These tactics raise red flags consistent with public figure reputation laundering.

---

## 4. Documented Controversy: Discord, Forums, and Polarization

Community sentiment toward LeCody is divided:

* **Admired for Technical Skill:** Posts like his LiFePO4 battery backup project illustrate deep knowledge and value.
* **Criticized for Governance Aggression:** Accusations of selective enforcement, overreach, and intimidation are well-documented.
* **Key Conflicts:** May 2020 dispute with Havens on Discord included allegations of unethical code conduct and manipulation.

These are not speculative. They are timestamped, archived, and publicly accessible.

## 5. Why This Record Matters

> **This is not harassment. This is historical preservation.**

### This exposé exists because:

* LeCody holds power through influence, not just position.
* Attempts to suppress facts erode public trust in digital platforms.
* Decentralized truth requires decentralized publishing.

> *If history can be edited by the powerful, then the powerless have no mirror.*
