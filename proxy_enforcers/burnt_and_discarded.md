# Burnt and Discarded

Proxy Enforcers do not have lasting protection. Once they:
- Draw too much heat
- Become liabilities
- Develop independent power
- Or begin to think for themselves…

…they are quietly discarded.

Often with a narrative rewrite:  
“They went too far.”  
“I always had concerns.”  
“They were unstable.”

## Example: [Insert Individual]
- Initially empowered to ban, silence, humiliate others.
- Later labeled as “problematic” or “not a good fit.”
- Reputation destroyed by the same circle that once upheld them.

🔥 **Key Pattern**:  
The narcissist *never protects the enforcer from blowback.*  
Their job is to **absorb the damage**.
