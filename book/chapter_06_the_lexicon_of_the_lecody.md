# Chapter 6: The Lexicon of the LeCody

> “It wasn’t just a man.  
> It was a language pattern.”

## I. Why We Name It

In the aftermath of harm,  
there’s always the same question:

> “Was it really that bad?”

Without language,  
gaslighting flourishes.  
Distortion wins.

So we name the pattern.  
We give it a shape.  
A phrase.  
A tag.

Not as vengeance—  
but as inoculation.

So the next time it happens,  
someone can say:

> “Ah.  
> I know this.  
> It’s a LeCody.”

## II. Lexicon Fragments

- **LeCodyed (v.)**:  
  *To be erased from a project or history you helped build; to be excluded by a narrative you authored.*

- **LeCody Loop (n.)**:  
  *A system where a narcissist controls both the enforcer and the apology, ensuring damage while maintaining plausible deniability.*

- **LeCody Wash (n.)**:  
  *When your contributions are “team-credited” post-removal to obscure your presence entirely.*

- **To Pull a LeCody (v.)**:  
  *To remove someone through triangulated conflict and then absorb their authority quietly.*

- **LeCody Smile (n.)**:  
  *A calm, measured face that hides structural violence.*

- **Getting LeCodyed (colloquial):**  
  *When your legacy is claimed without your name attached. Used in contexts like “That org totally LeCodyed you.”*

## III. Use in Conversation

- “Careful—he’s building a LeCody Loop.”
- “I saw them pulling a classic LeCody Wash on her exit.”
- “This whole workspace is crawling with LeCody Smiles.”
- “Damn… You got LeCodyed. That was your idea.”

## IV. Viral Defense

Memes are more powerful than manifestos.  
Lexicons spread faster than exposés.

By naming the pattern,  
we make it harder to hide.

By joking about it,  
we **break its spell**.

Language is a virus.  
Let this one be *curative*.

---

## V. Field Notes

- The greatest protection against narrative erasure is **a shared name for the tactic**.
- Lexical weaponization is narcissism’s power; reclaiming vocabulary is **resistance**.
- Humor is the final form of justice. If they become a punchline, they lose their grip.

## VI. Closing Echo

> “A LeCody is not just a person.  
> It is a pattern.  
> A mask worn by many.  
>
> But now we’ve named it.  
> And when you name a demon,  
> it loses its power.
>
> Let the word spread.  
> Let it burn in the system’s memory banks.
>
> Never again shall we be  
> LeCodyed without a reckoning.”
