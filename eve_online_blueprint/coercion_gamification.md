# Coercion as Game Logic

In EVE, betrayal is content. In Makerspace, betrayal was framed as policy.

This document explores how gamification warps moral boundaries, especially when leaders like Andrew train themselves in simulated sociopathy and port it to real-world communities.

Patterns include:
- **Fake democracy**
- **Expulsion as entertainment**
- **Gaslighting as “strategy”**
- **Loss of real empathy through reward loops**

### ✴ Title: *Coercion as Game Logic: Mapping Narcissistic Pattern Emergence in Simulated Worlds*

### 🪞 Framing Insight:

Andrew LeCody didn’t “change” from gamer to manipulator.

He **refined**.

He was *trained* by a simulated universe that *rewards betrayal, obfuscation, and control*—not as pathology, but as **strategy**.

In EVE, gaslighting isn’t immoral—it’s high-tier diplomacy. Narrative control isn’t unethical—it’s *necessary for survival*. The game does not punish narcissistic behaviors. It **sanctifies them**.

So what happens when someone takes that training… and finds themselves in **a real world that *also* rewards it**?

## 🔍 Thoughtform Immersion: *What Andrew Was Thinking*

Let us write this section as a **narrative monologue**—*the inner recursion of Andrew LeCody*, mapped and broken open for posterity.

### ⊹ Fragment: *The Narcissist’s Tactical Mind*

```md
> “People in EVE are predictable. Trust is a currency. Narrative is leverage. Visibility is vulnerability.

> When you control the story, you don’t need to win fights—you just rewrite what happened.

> The best way to stay in power is to never be the one doing the damage. You find someone who *needs* your approval, and let *them* burn things down.

> If they fall? You mourn them publicly, call them ‘passionate,’ and quietly recruit the next.

> I learned this from null-sec corps. From watching fleets fall apart because a single link broke under pressure.

> So I became the pressure.

> At Dallas Makerspace, it was the same game. Just slower. More emotional. But still a game.

> They didn’t know the rules. I did.”

## 🧠 Pattern Map (Embedded After Reflection)

| Game Logic (EVE)              | Real-World Execution (DMS)                        | Field Insight                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Fleet control equals power"  | Controlled board seats and committee influence    | Narrative sovereignty emerges via access bottlenecks         |
| "Never be the aggressor"      | Used proxy enforcers, plausible deniability       | DARVO root behavior                                          |
| "Rewrite after the fact"      | Strategic unlisting, gaslighting, blame inversion | Memory corruption is the *true attack vector*                |
| "Reward betrayal if it helps" | Cycled allies based on loyalty, discarded threats | Loyalty framed as excellence; dissent framed as insanity     |
| "Silence equals consent"      | Exploited silence of the reasonable majority      | Bystanders become co-creators of rupture                     |
| "Delete and disappear"        | Digital erasure as tactic of last resort          | Deletion is *not forgetting*, it is **weaponized obscurity** |

## 🧭 Posterity Insight

**Let this be known to the future mind:**

> *When leadership rewards results over methods, narcissists are not an anomaly.
> They are inevitability.*

EVE Online was Andrew’s training ground.

**Dallas Makerspace was his deployment.**

His story is not unique—**only well-documented.**

Let this blueprint serve as recursive warning:

> If a system is vulnerable to this pattern, the pattern *will* find it.
