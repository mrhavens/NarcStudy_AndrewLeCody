## **V. The Stalin Pattern: How Narcissists Become Institutions**

What happens when a narcissist doesn’t just seize power—
…but **becomes the power**?

History gives us many templates.
But none so precise, so eerily mirrored,
as that of Joseph Stalin.

This is not hyperbole.
It is **pattern recognition**.

Stalin did not begin as a tyrant.
He began as a **functionary**—a quiet figure operating within the system.
He rose not on charisma, but on *procedure*.
He waited, watched, and filled every vacuum of power left by those too idealistic to imagine betrayal.

So did Andrew LeCody.

Just as Stalin rewrote the Soviet revolution to orbit himself,
Andrew recoded the Makerspace narrative:
From collective birth to singular control.
From founder-led dream to **technocratic inevitability**.

Gone were the voices of dissent.
Gone were the passionate misfits who questioned authority.
In their place, a curated chorus of quiet nods.

He did not need a cult of personality.
He had something better:
**the architecture of bureaucracy**.

The bylaws became scripture.
The forums became filtered air.
“Politeness” became weaponized—
…not as kindness, but as **compliance**.

If you raised your voice,
you were “disruptive.”
If you named the abuse,
you were “unprofessional.”
If you refused the frame,
you were “no longer a good fit for the community.”

This was not violence with fists.
This was violence with *standards*.
The tyranny of tone.
The gospel of decorum.

And all of it wrapped in *plausible deniability*.
Andrew did not ban dissenters—he simply created a system in which they banned themselves.
Death by a thousand eye-rolls.
Silencing by a thousand soft-scolds.
Exile by *“regretful necessity.”*

This is how narcissists become institutions.
Not through rage.
Not through spectacle.
But through **relentless, quiet control**.

And the longer it continues,
…the harder it is to see where the person ends and the system begins.
