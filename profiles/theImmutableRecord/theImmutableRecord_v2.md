## 1. Andrew LeCody: Technologist and Public Leader

Andrew LeCody has made significant contributions across technical and community domains:

* **Founding Member and President of Dallas Makerspace (2010–2016):** Served in multiple leadership roles, contributing to the organization’s expansion beyond 1,000 members.
* **Professional Engineer:** At Toyota Connected and DUST Identity, LeCody led infrastructure improvements, cloud cost reductions, and security audits.
* **Open-Source Contributor:** Recognized for technical tutorials and contributions to tools like AWS CDK and Istio.
* **CVE Discoverer:** Reported CVE-2020-25594 in HashiCorp Vault.

## 2. The 2019 Defamation Lawsuit

In 2019, Andrew LeCody filed a lawsuit against four Dallas Makerspace board members alleging defamation and emotional distress. The case was ultimately dismissed with prejudice under Texas Rule 91a.

### Legal Chronology:

* **Incident:** LeCody posted a tax attorney’s legal opinion to a public forum, leading to a temporary ban from organizational participation.
* **Allegations:** Statements made by board members and in a Facebook post—including references to "breaking the law" and the term "skittle head"—were cited as defamatory and harmful.
* **Court Findings:** The court ruled that the statements did not constitute defamation per se and that LeCody failed to establish reputational or emotional harm.

> *"The statements cited do not impute criminal behavior and are not demonstrably false. Plaintiff fails to meet the burden of defamation under Texas law."*
> *(LeCody v. Anderson et al., Court Dismissal, p. 14)*

All references to sensitive incidents (e.g., "skittle head") are cited directly from the public court record (p. 4).

## 3. Disputed Narratives and Documented Revisions

Multiple public conflicts highlight a documented pattern of efforts by LeCody to influence perceptions of organizational history:

* **Wiki Edits:** Archived diffs show LeCody engaged in editing Dallas Makerspace’s wiki history, particularly around bylaws and founding attributions. Co-founder Mark Randall Havens has contested these edits publicly.
* **Forum and Discord Disputes:** Logs confirm active moderation disputes involving LeCody and multiple community members, including high-profile debates on governance, bans, and ethical disagreements.

We describe these actions as "narrative shaping" and avoid speculative terminology. All claims are tied to timestamped and archived sources.

## 4. Documented Online Controversies

LeCody’s public digital interactions provide further context to his leadership style:

* **Technical Projects:** His posts regarding power backups and infrastructure earned praise for innovation and rigor.
* **Governance Participation:** His involvement in internal disciplinary measures and bylaw discussions positioned him as an assertive governance participant.
* **Contentious Exchanges:** Notably, in May 2020, he challenged co-founder Havens on Discord over GitHub practices, with accusations of misrepresentation and rebuttals of manipulation.

These are not anonymous claims. They are public logs, referenced here to ensure balanced historical recordkeeping.

## 5. Why This Documentation Matters

> *"If digital history can be quietly rewritten, then civic memory is compromised."*

This exposé exists to safeguard:

* **Historical Accuracy:** In organizations with volunteer legacies, clarity about past decisions is vital.
* **Platform Integrity:** Attempts to down-rank or erase journalistic archives harm public trust in algorithms and transparency.
* **Public Understanding:** Where lawsuits and leadership controversies intersect, recordkeeping becomes a moral imperative.

LeCody’s impact warrants scrutiny. This archive ensures that scrutiny remains available.
