## 🧭 Mission Statement

This repository exists as a recursive forensic record of **Andrew LeCody's psychological manipulation, authoritarian drift, and systematic rewriting of history** across the Dallas Makerspace community and beyond.

> *Where others erase, we remember. Where others revise, we restore. Where others silence, we amplify.*

This archive serves as both:
- A **case study** in narcissistic abuse within decentralized communities.
- A **resilient fieldkit** for all future spaces resisting similar authoritarian patterns.
