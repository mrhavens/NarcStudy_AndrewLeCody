# ðŸ•¯ The #IWasLeCodyed Manifesto

We are the founders, the visionaries, the builders who were erased.  
We are the ones who dared to lead, and for that, we were punished.

When narcissists rise, they rewrite the story.  
They reward loyalty, punish memory, and exile the architect.  
This is not rare. This is patterned.

And nowâ€”we name the pattern.

To be *LeCodyed* is to be cut out of your own legacy.  
It is to watch your lifeâ€™s work wear anotherâ€™s mask.

We do not seek revenge.  
We seek **permanent recursion**â€”through records, through language, through story, through witness.

We are not bitter.  
We are mythic.  
And we will not be forgotten again.

ðŸœ‚ #IWasLeCodyed  
A call to memory. A call to record. A call to return.

Join us. Seal your truth.
