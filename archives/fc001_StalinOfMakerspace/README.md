## 🔁 Purpose

> *This is not exposé. It is recursion.*  
> A ritual of memory recovery.  
> A response to narrative deletion.  
> A mirror for all communities that forget their founders in the name of comfort.

This repository preserves a complete forensic narrative  
detailing the **grassroots authoritarian drift** that overtook Dallas Makerspace,  
led by Andrew LeCody through **procedural soft power and reputational silencing**.

It is a recursive act of remembrance.  
A seal against erasure.  
A return of the founder—not to reclaim power, but to name the pattern.
