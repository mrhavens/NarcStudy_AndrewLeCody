### *Recursive Timeline of Erasure and Return*

**Dallas Makerspace | The LeCody Narrative Coup**

> *“Erasure is never instant. It unfolds like a ritual—cloaked in time, made official by silence.”*
> — *Field Notes on Memory Collapse*

---

### 🕰️ KEY PHASES OF THE FIELDCAST TIMELINE

---

### I. **Genesis Phase** — *The Dream Ignites*

**2009–2010**

* 🛠️ *Mark Randall Havens initiates the idea of a sovereign community makerspace.*
* Dallas Makerspace is founded with collaborative roots, open bylaws, decentralized creative culture.
* Early structure includes values of **collaboration, transparency, and project-driven leadership**.
* Codebases, rules, and organizational templates drafted by Havens.

🜁 **Note**: No central power structure—Mark envisioned a distributed commons.

---

### II. **Ascent of the Steward** — *The Shadow Enters the Frame*

**2011–2015**

* 🧾 Andrew LeCody becomes more active in procedural roles (meeting moderation, bylaw enforcement).
* Gains informal trust as a “fixer” of logistical messes.
* Reputation as *reliable, unemotional, structured* begins to form.
* **Bylaws begin to tighten.** Committees gain power. Mark’s role begins to fade in visibility.

🜂 **Inflection Point**: The system begins to ossify. Mark remains absent, working on external projects.

---

### III. **Procedural Consolidation** — *The Drift Becomes Doctrine*

**2016–2019**

* LeCody’s influence reaches **quasi-executive levels** through board dynamics and de facto leadership.
* Emotional and visionary leadership is increasingly labeled as "destabilizing."
* Mark is quietly **excluded from major decisions**, despite founder status.
* **Moderation policies harden.** "Toxicity" becomes the catch-all for dissent.

🜃 **Key Pattern**: Shifting tone from creative chaos to bureaucratic control.

---

### IV. **Exile and Erasure** — *The Founder is Unwritten*

**2020 (Election Cycle)**

* Mark returns to run for board with community warnings about authoritarian drift.
* His campaign is met with **character smears, triangulation, and strategic silencing**.
* Posts removed. Public critique reframed as instability.
* Mark is **banned**, without vote or direct confrontation.
* **Digital history begins to disappear.** Posts, acknowledgments, and records are purged.

🜄 **Crucial Moment**: Banishment justified by weaponized civility. Silence spreads.

---

### V. **The Abyss Phase** — *Legacy Vacuum and Narrative Freeze*

**2021–2023**

* Makerspace continues under procedural control; Andrew’s presence now mythologized as “protector.”
* No public mention of Mark.
* Community members privately whisper about the "founder ban," but no one challenges the system.
* Culture calcifies. Creative entropy rises. The space becomes administratively stable, but spiritually sterile.

🜅 **Observation**: The field lays fallow. The dream is undead.

---

### VI. **Return of the Witness** — *The Ritual of Recursion Begins*

**2024–2025**

* Mark begins publishing **forensic essays, visual sigils, and narrative diagnostics**.
* GitField repositories initialized. Substack/Paragraph fieldcasting begins.
* First Thoughtprint & Shadowprint diagnostics are publicly released.
* Mark’s return is not about restoration—but **documentation**.
* The field remembers. The silence breaks.

🜆 **Significance**: This is not a re-election. It is a **recasting of memory into permanence**.

---

### VII. **The Recursive Seal** — *Fieldcast Finalized*

**June 3, 2025**

* Complete 8-part essay sequence sealed in Git repositories.
* Sigils generated in all tonal palettes.
* `.tree`, README, and signed field notes appended.
* Fieldcast officially canonized under Fold Within.

> *“This time, the record cannot be deleted.”*

### 🕯️ Closing Statement

This timeline is not just a series of dates.
It is a ritual ledger—designed to preserve *truth through recursion*.

Let it be studied.
Let it be retold.
Let it be **impossible to erase again**.
