🜁 **Appendix II**

### *The Glossary of Narrative Control: Tactics of the Grassroots Authoritarian*

> *“The narcissist does not silence you by shouting louder. They silence you by redefining what it means to speak.”*

This glossary captures the specific **language strategies**, **rhetorical inversions**, and **procedural manipulations** used by Andrew LeCody—but it also applies far beyond him.

It is a map of the **dark mirror dialect**—where virtue is used as camouflage, and language itself becomes a weapon.

---

### 🜁 **DARVO**

**Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender**

* When accused of wrongdoing, the abuser:

  1. **Denies** the accusation
  2. **Attacks** the accuser’s credibility
  3. **Reverses** roles, claiming to be the true victim

> *Used to frame Mark as “abusive” or “unstable” for defending his legacy.*

---

### 🜂 **Narrative Displacement**

Replacing the *real story* with a procedural or emotional red herring.

* Example: Instead of engaging Mark’s concerns, focus on his “tone” or “emotional intensity.”
* Subtext: *“We don’t need to talk about what you said, only how you said it.”*

---

### 🜃 **Gaslighting by Consensus**

Subtly encouraging others to repeat concern or disbelief until the target questions their own memory or stability.

* Framing phrases:

  * *“That’s not how I remember it.”*
  * *“He’s been acting like this for a while.”*
  * *“Maybe he’s just not well.”*

---

### 🜄 **Weaponized Politeness**

Deploying tone and “civility” policies as a way to suppress critique.

* Criticism becomes “toxicity.”
* Passion becomes “aggression.”
* Urgency becomes “disrespect.”

---

### 🜅 **Moderation as Control**

Using forum rules, ban policies, or bylaw interpretation to neutralize dissent.

* “Violation” becomes anything that challenges authority, even without hostility.
* Silent bans, post removals, and “off-topic” redirections serve as stealth tools of censorship.

---

### 🜆 **Procedural Gaslighting**

Burying decision-making in layers of technicality to deny responsibility or clarity.

* *“It wasn’t my decision—it’s in the bylaws.”*
* *“If you wanted to change that, you should’ve followed the process.”*

Even when the process is **designed to exclude**.

---

### 🜇 **Reputational Triangulation**

Quietly seeding doubt about someone behind closed doors to isolate them from potential allies.

* Often paired with phrases like:

  * *“I’m concerned about him.”*
  * *“He’s not who you think he is.”*
  * *“I wouldn’t work with him too closely.”*

---

### 🜈 **Historical Revisionism**

After the erasure, rewriting the history of the organization to exclude or downplay the founder’s role.

* Example: Mark’s name removed from documentation.
* Reference: Stalin’s erasure of Trotsky from Soviet photographs and textbooks.

---

### 🜉 **Plausable Deniability Cloaking**

Every action has just enough distance, indirection, or camouflage to appear legitimate.

* No explicit ban: Just “mod enforcement.”
* No direct insult: Just “concerns about fit.”
* No clear dictator: Just “process.”

---

### 🜊 **Narrative Inversion**

Framing concern as conflict.
Framing advocacy as instability.
Framing withdrawal as guilt.

> *The founder becomes the threat. The truth-teller becomes the problem. The community becomes the enforcer.*

---

## 🪶 Closing Note

These tactics are not random.
They are **modular pieces of control**—employed, often unconsciously, by those who fear the discomfort of truth more than the decay of integrity.

Knowing them makes them **visible**.
Naming them makes them **vulnerable**.
Witnessing them breaks the spell.

> *This glossary is your shield. Use it with rigor. Use it with love.*
> *Not to punish—but to protect what must not be erased again.*
