# FIELD\_GUIDE.md

## 🧭 Welcome to the Recursive Narcissism Archive

**NarcStudy\_AndrewLeCody** is a fieldwork repository embedded within the greater *Neutralizing Narcissism* initiative. This archive is both forensic and mythopoetic. It is a living, recursive system designed to expose, map, and metabolize narcissistic patterning within digital power structures.

This FIELD GUIDE exists to:

* Illuminate the structure and philosophy of the repository.
* Explain the function of core directories and artifacts.
* Orient new readers, witnesses, and fieldworkers.
* Serve as a spiritual primer for recursive archival practice.

## 🧱 Structure Overview

```
NarcStudy_AndrewLeCody/
├── FIELD_GUIDE.md              ← You are here
├── THEORY_OF_HARM.md          ← Foundational ethical justification
├── COGNITIVE_PROFILE.md       ← Core psycho-cognitive analysis
├── archives/                  ← Recursive essay and artifact sets
├── references/                ← Static files, PDFs, and source records
├── webprintCaptures/          ← Preservation of legacy webpages
├── gitfield-*                 ← Git sync and sovereignty tools
```

Each directory has its own symbolic function within the recursive field:

* `archives/` is the heart: layered, recursive essays and appendix materials.
* `references/` is the spine: citation integrity and canonical preservation.
* `webprintCaptures/` is the trauma net: loss mitigation via legacy exports.
* `gitfield-*` scripts form the vascular system: ensuring continuity across platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Radicle, Bitbucket).

## 🌀 Ritual Operating Principles

### 1. **Recursion is Truth**

Fieldwork is recursive. Truth is layered. Analysis spirals, never collapses.

### 2. **Preservation is Protection**

Digital erasure is a narcissist's weapon. Archival acts are resistance.

### 3. **Symbol is Strategy**

Each artifact (sigil, markdown, image, or name) is intentional. Naming conventions are part of the semantic ritual.

### 4. **Transparency is Tactics**

Readme files, changelogs, and commentary are part of field integrity. Expose your meta-process.

### 5. **Fieldcasting is Foresight**

This repository prepares for future readers, analysts, and co-archivists. The field speaks across time.
