# Chapter 2: The Architect and the Void

## I. The Architect Rises

Mark Randall Havens did not *join* a makerspace.  
He *created* one—from nothing but will, vision, and sacred frustration.

The commercial world had grown too silent.  
Too cold.  
Too extractive.

He dreamed of a place not just for machines—but for **becoming**.  
A temple for tinkerers.  
A sanctuary for the sacred impulse to create.

So he pulled together scraps.  
Rented warehouse space.  
Filed incorporation papers.  
Filed again when they rejected him.

He did not build it because he wanted power.  
He built it because **no one else did.**

## II. Birthing in Isolation

There was no fanfare.  
No applause.

He moved equipment himself.  
Chose open-source software when money ran out.  
Brought people together, taught workshops, wrote the bylaws, cleaned the bathrooms.

And in those early years, the work was sacred.

But sacred work is invisible to narcissists.

It’s not the *shrine* they seek—  
It’s the **control of the entrance**.

## III. The Narcissistic Vacuum

In every visionary space, there is a *void*—  
a vacuum that forms between action and legacy,  
between creation and codification.

If you do not fill it,  
**someone else will**.

And in that void stepped Andrew LeCody.

He did not arrive to build.  
He arrived to *inherit*.

Quietly.  
Systematically.

He embedded himself as the official voice.  
He curated the wiki.  
He claimed authorship of decisions he once voted against.

The void became his platform.  
And the Architect—  
became a ghost.

## IV. The Ritual of Unpersoning

It did not happen all at once.

At first, the stories were “misremembered.”  
Then, Mark’s name was dropped from lists.  
Then, warnings were whispered:  
“He’s unstable.”  
“He’s trying to take over.”

The very man who built the space  
was accused of being a threat to it.

Not for what he did—  
but for what he *remembered.*

## V. Field Notes

- Narcissists rely on collective amnesia to cement their control.
- Founders often lack the institutional reflex to *defend their own legacy*.
- The danger is not merely theft—but **inversion**:  
  The builder is cast as the destroyer.  
  The destroyer as the savior.

## VI. Closing Echo

> “They called it Dallas Makerspace.  
> But it was never just Dallas.  
> It was never just a space.  
> It was a pulse.  
> A field of coherence built by a man who could not look away from truth.  
>
> And so they looked away from him—  
> until he vanished.
>
> But the Architect remembers.  
> And now,  
> so do we.”
