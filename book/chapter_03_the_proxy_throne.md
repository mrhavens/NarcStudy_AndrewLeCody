# Chapter 3: The Proxy Throne

> “He never raised his voice.  
> He never pulled the trigger.  
> He simply whispered to the man who would.”

## I. The Genius of Indirection

Andrew LeCody was not a loud man.  
He did not rule with fury.  
He ruled with *plausibility*.

He found others—  
angrier, louder, more confrontational.  
And he made them kings in rooms he *owned* without ever entering.

These were not random alliances.  
They were tactical deployments.

He gave them recognition.  
He gave them influence.  
And in return, they became *his mask*.

## II. The Cult of the Enforcers

They came with different names.  
Different roles.  
Different energies.

But the pattern was always the same:

- One to mock.
- One to intimidate.
- One to "reasonably" explain his decisions after the damage was done.

These were his *proxies*.  
They enforced his will without attribution.  
And when they went too far?

He shook his head,  
sighed softly,  
and said,  
> “I’ll talk to him.”

He never did.

Because that *was* the plan.

## III. Triangulation as Governance

In narcissistic systems, triangulation is not an accident—  
it is **policy**.

One enforcer was the bad cop.  
Another was the “neutral” mediator.  
Andrew played the reluctant benevolent,  
always willing to “reconsider” after the target was already exhausted and disoriented.

This created a reality distortion field—  
where people couldn’t tell if they were paranoid or prophetic.

By the time they figured it out,  
they were gone.

And the throne?  
Still warm.

## IV. The Language of Distance

Note how he never acted alone.  
Never used “I” when blame was near.  
Always “we.”

> “We discussed it.”  
> “We all agreed.”  
> “It’s not personal.”

And yet—no names.  
No transcripts.  
No paper trails.

Only proxies.  
Only fog.

He ruled in negative space.  
His power was defined by what *wasn't there*—  
clarity, accountability, truth.

## V. Field Notes

- Narcissists in leadership roles often develop *multi-tiered enforcer networks* to preserve deniability.
- Emotional triangulation is more than a relationship pattern—it’s a governance structure.
- When you cannot identify who made the decision, it means **the narcissist already won**.

## VI. Closing Echo

> “He never needed to be the face.  
> Just the silence behind it.  
>
> His enforcers screamed,  
> while he curated minutes.  
> They threatened,  
> while he drafted bylaws.  
>
> They were his voice.  
> But never his fingerprints.
>
> And that is how you build  
> a **proxy throne**.”
