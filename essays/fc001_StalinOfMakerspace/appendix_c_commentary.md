### *The Proxy’s Plea: A Recursive Interpretation of Cole LeCody’s Essay*

---

> *“The most effective tool of erasure is not silence—it is a sympathetic voice speaking the wrong story.”*
> — *The Empathic Technologist*

---

Cole LeCody’s *“A Girl and Her Makerspace”* is not a neutral account.
It is a strategic **proxy artifact**—a rhetorical shield for her husband, Andrew LeCody, written at the precise moment public sympathy was turning against him.

This appendix reframes that essay **not as a primary source**,
…but as a **ritual of narrative inversion**—worthy of archiving because it is **evidence** of how power defends itself with emotion.

---

### 🔍 Purpose of Inclusion

* **Preservation** of publicly published narrative used in defense of Andrew LeCody post-banishment
* **Deconstruction** of its rhetorical structure to illuminate subtle techniques of proxy defense
* **Contextual positioning** within the broader Fieldcast for recursive integrity and historical clarity

### 🧷 Pattern Analysis: Narrative Devices in Use

| Device                       | Description                                                          | Detected In Cole’s Essay                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emotional Primacy**        | Opening with vulnerability to disarm critique                        | “The fire has burned me clean through…”                                                   |
| **Romantic Association**     | Reframing organizational conflict as personal tragedy                | “I’ve lost what this place once meant to me…”                                             |
| **Legacy Appeal**            | Repetition of early contributions to establish moral authority       | Emphasizes early board membership, tool purchases, sweat equity                           |
| **Proxy Absolutism**         | Using personal credibility to defend another’s actions               | Consistently reframes Andrew’s role as misunderstood rather than procedural               |
| **Displacement of Critique** | Moving from objective abuse to subjective feeling                    | Centering her feelings of loss rather than Andrew’s public accountability                 |
| **Victim Inflation**         | Framing herself and Andrew as symbolic martyrs                       | “I wanted this story to take the internet by storm…”                                      |
| **Erasure Inversion**        | Claiming she was erased, while ignoring Mark Randall Havens entirely | Makes no mention of the founder, while claiming miscredit for “first female board member” |

### 🜁 Recursive Parallels to the Stalin Pattern

In *05\_stalin\_pattern.md*, we detail how bureaucratic narcissists often use **“politeness, proxies, and procedural ambiguity”** to overwrite memory.

Cole’s essay fits squarely into this pattern:

* It **redirects** attention from Andrew’s procedural abuses to a **romanticized history**.
* It **disguises** the architecture of power behind **emotional sentiment**.
* It **replaces Mark’s story** with a story that **never mentions him**—a second-order erasure.

### 🜂 Fieldcast Significance

This document **must not be read as truth**,
but as a **narrative weapon**—and now,
as **evidence of pattern behavior**.

It is preserved in full in `appendix_c_cole_lecody_statement.md`
not to grant it power, but to **defuse it through recursion**.

The field remembers what the proxy attempts to overwrite.

### 🕯 Final Invocation

> *Every narrative has a shadow.*
> *This one wore sentiment as armor.*
> *We do not attack it. We include it.*
> *Not because it is sacred—*
> *But because the sacred includes the whole pattern.*
>
> *We remember the founder.*
> *We remember the truth.*
> *We remember the proxy’s plea…*
> *and we answer it with recursion.*
