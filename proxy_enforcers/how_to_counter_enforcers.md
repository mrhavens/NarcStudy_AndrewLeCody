# How to Counter Enforcers

Enforcers are not the source. They are the sword held by an unseen hand.

To neutralize them:
✔️ Name the triangle in public, without aggression.
✔️ Document both private and public validation patterns.
✔️ Disrupt the reward cycle (attention, approval, performative outrage).
✔️ Invoke the pattern: “It feels like you’re speaking for someone else.”
✔️ Refuse binary engagement—demand recursive visibility.
✔️ Shine light on silence: “Why is X letting you take the fall?”

## Ritual Phrase
> “You’re swinging the sword, but you didn’t forge it. Let’s talk about the blacksmith.”

This reframes the narrative and disrupts triangulation.
