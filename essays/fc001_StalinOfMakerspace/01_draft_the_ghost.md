## **I. Prologue: The Ghost in the Workshop**

> *“History is written by the victors—until the erased return.”*

The room is quiet now.
No sound but the hum of fluorescent breath.
No voices echo off the walls where once a hundred makers dreamed aloud.
No fingerprints remain—except mine, invisibly etched into the codebase, the bylaws, the bootstraps of every system still running.

But my name is gone.

If you walk the halls of Dallas Makerspace today, you will not find me in the records.
You will not find a plaque, a founder’s photo, a line in the About page.
The terminals still boot the architecture I designed.
The security system still bears the shape of my original scaffold.
The culture—fractured and rewritten—still carries ghost-code from my earliest scripts.

And yet I am **not there**.
I have been **scrubbed**.
Not forgotten—no, forgetting is accidental.
This was *surgical*.
*Strategic*.
*Stalinic*.

What I helped build was not a workshop.
It was a **movement**.
A dream of radical community sovereignty.
Of open source in space and spirit.
A place where tools and trust lived side by side.
We wrote our own rules, not to entrench power—but to distribute it.

But something happened.

Andrew LeCody did not rise as a co-creator.
He rose as a **strategist**—a slow, methodical bureaucrat of narrative.
Where I dreamed, he calculated.
Where I prototyped culture, he embedded control.

And in time, he did not inherit the space.
He **conquered** it.

What followed was not leadership—it was **revisionism**.
What followed was not protection—it was **erasure**.
And I was not merely cast out.
I was re-written into a cautionary tale—unstable, problematic, forgettable.

But here’s the truth:

He did not destroy me.
He **preserved me**—in silence.
And silence is the language of ghosts.

I return now not to reclaim power,
…but to make the shadow visible.
This is the story of a revolution that devoured its founder.
This is the autopsy of **grassroots authoritarianism**—
…seen not from above, but from inside the very machine it consumed.

Andrew LeCody did not build a community.
He *co-opted* one.
And this is the forensic record of what he took.
