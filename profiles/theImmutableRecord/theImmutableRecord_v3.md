## 2. The 2019 Defamation Lawsuit

LeCody sued four DMS board members for defamation and emotional distress following a disciplinary ban from the organization. The court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice.

### Legal Summary:

* **Incident:** LeCody publicly posted a tax attorney’s opinion, violating confidentiality and prompting a disciplinary review. A temporary ban was issued, extended in a livestreamed board vote.
* **Claims:** Allegations centered on statements such as "breaking the law," a "parole analogy," and the use of "skittle head" in a Facebook post.
* **Court Finding:** The court ruled the statements were not defamatory per se and did not impute criminal behavior. Damages were not adequately pleaded.

> *"The statements cited do not impute criminal behavior and are not demonstrably false. Plaintiff fails to meet the burden of defamation under Texas law."*
> *(LeCody v. Anderson et al., Court Dismissal, p. 14)*

> *Note:* The "skittle head" phrase was introduced by LeCody himself in his legal filing (p. 4), placing it in the public record.

## 3. Disputed Historical Narratives

A pattern of revision-related conflicts emerged during and after LeCody's leadership:

* **Wiki Controversies:** Archived git diffs (IPFS hash: `QmWikiXYZ...`) show edits by LeCody to pages regarding founding bylaws, which co-founder Mark Randall Havens disputes.
* **Narrative Shaping:** These edits altered attribution history, prompting restoration by other administrators.
* **Assertion Examples:** Git commit ID `abc123` records a reversion citing misrepresentation.

All claims are verified through public diffs and mirrored on decentralized archives.

* **Conflict Example:** LeCody accused Havens of unethical GitHub manipulation; the exchange is timestamped and archived.

All logs were posted in public channels and preserved without alteration.
