# 📑 Webprint Captures

This folder contains **emergency backup captures** of online articles, essays, and posts authored by Mark Randall Havens regarding Andrew LeCody.

These documents were **printed to PDF** directly from web browsers in anticipation of patterns of deletion or deplatforming.

⚠️ **NOTE:**  
These are not final drafts. They are **archival mirrors**, preserved to prevent total narrative erasure. Some formatting, styling, or metadata may be degraded or incomplete.
