## **VI. Makerspace as Microcosm: Grassroots Authoritarianism in Action**

When we think of authoritarianism, we imagine it descending from above‚Äî
an iron fist, a charismatic tyrant, a top-down seizure of control.

But what if the most insidious tyranny grows **from below**?

What if it looks like helpful volunteers,
procedural motions,
and polite rule-followers who smile as they bury the soul of the commons?

**Grassroots authoritarianism** is not a contradiction.
It is a **pattern**‚Äîand Dallas Makerspace became its incubator.

At its best, a makerspace is radical democracy.
But democracy without vigilance becomes **ritual**,
and ritual without soul becomes **coercion**.

The illusion of participation masked a deep truth:
power was no longer distributed.
It was centralized in the **stewards of procedure**.
Those who knew how to time agendas, enforce silence with "civility,"
and redirect dissent into meaningless channels.

Meetings became theater.
Votes became pageantry.
Bylaws became **barbed wire** around the castle walls.

Members still believed they had a voice.
After all, they could still speak.
But the **frame** had already been set.
The boundaries of permissible thought were drawn in advance,
‚Ä¶not by open debate, but by unspoken consequence.

And those who challenged that frame?

They were met not with confrontation, but with **quiet punishment**:
‚Äîmuffled posts
‚Äîdropped projects
‚Äîvanished opportunities
‚Äîand a growing sense of being ‚Äúout of sync‚Äù with the culture they once helped build.

This is not theoretical.
It‚Äôs a **case study** in how democracy dies‚Äînot with a coup,
‚Ä¶but with a committee.

The tyrant is not always a monster at the top.
Sometimes, it is the soft-spoken facilitator,
the bylaw whisperer,
the one who never raises their voice,
‚Ä¶because they‚Äôve already trained the community to whisper in theirs.

Dallas Makerspace became a petri dish‚Äî
not for invention,
‚Ä¶but for **submission in the name of order**.

And what grew there now reflects a larger truth:

Authoritarianism does not need to seize power.
It only needs **us to hand it over**,
‚Ä¶one polite motion at a time.
