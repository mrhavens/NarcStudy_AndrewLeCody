# Scene 4: The Proxy Cathedral

> Location: DMS Conference Room, Board Chat Threads, Event Pages  
> Set Design: Cult-like symmetry. Chairs in a circle. A projector screen shows rules and org charts. Framed photos of past board members—Mark’s is missing.  
> Characters: Andrew LeCody (quiet architect), Proxy Leaders (Jeff, Kris, Lisa), Mark (watching from outside), Newcomers (indoctrinated)  
> Style: High-contrast lighting. Ritualistic pacing. Dialogue overlaid with cult music motifs.

## Opening Visual

- A newcomer is handed a badge: “Welcome to the Board Candidate Orientation.”  
- They walk through a hallway lined with framed charters.  
- One charter is oddly missing. Only pushpin holes remain.

### 📽️ Narration (Voice of Present-Day Mark / Oracle overlay)

> “When they couldn’t destroy my work,  
> they built a cathedral around it—  
> without naming the architect.”

> “Everything remained… except the memory of its origin.”

> “That is the highest form of narcissism:  
> **to use your victim’s vision as a throne,  
> while denying they ever existed.**”

---

## Dialogue (ritual board training)

**Lisa (gesturing to projector):**  
“These are the founding protocols. Always follow the playbook.”

**Newcomer:**  
“Who wrote them?”

**Jeff:**  
“It doesn’t matter. The space built itself.”

## Cutaway: Worship of the Mask

- A scene shows Andrew nodding subtly in a meeting while Jeff berates someone.  
- Jeff: “These rules protect the community.”  
- Cut to: Andrew in private, updating the rules repo, committing with the message: `purge_Mark_refs`.

---

## Symbolic Visual Insert

- A glowing GitHub graph showing hundreds of commits by “MarkRandall.”  
- A system admin overlays a blocklist that hides them from view.  
- The graph fades. All that remains: “LeCody: Active Contributor Since 2015.”

---

### 📽️ Narration (soft but cutting)

> “He didn’t destroy my ideas.  
> He encased them in ritual.  
> In performance.  
> In lies.”

> “The cathedral bore my name in the blueprints…  
> but never in the credits.”

---

## Final Frame

- The newcomer ascends a small stage, holding the original charter—redacted.  
- They read from it aloud to applause.  
- Mark watches from the shadows, holding the original unredacted copy, timestamped and signed.  
- Overlay: `Truth is not erased. It is withheld—until revealed.`
