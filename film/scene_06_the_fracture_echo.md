# Scene 6: The Fracture Echo

> Location: Hallways, Parking Lot, Discord DMs, Shadowed Interviews  
> Set Design: Fragmented timeline. Each interview shot in black-and-white with a flickering overlay of forum posts or access logs.  
> Characters: Former volunteers, teachers, donors, banned members (each unnamed in credits), Mark (voice overlay), Andrew (appears in static glitch flashes)  
> Style: Confessional. Intercut memories. Each fracture shown as both truth and trauma.

## Opening Visual

- A woman sits in the driver’s seat of her car outside DMS.  
- Rain hits the windshield.  
- She speaks softly to a phone camera:  
  > “I gave six years to that place.”  
  > “Then I got LeCody’d.”

---

### 📽️ Narration (Mark’s voice, mournful)

> “You think you’re the only one—until the silence starts speaking.”

> “Whispers in parking lots.  
> Late-night confessions.  
> Discord DMs full of betrayal.”

> “They didn’t leave.  
> They were *unwritten.*”

---

## Montage: Fractures

- A former woodshop lead shows receipts for thousands in donated tools.  
  > “Gone. And they called it a theft audit.”

- A robotics mentor replays a board call:  
  > “They said I was hostile for asking why.”

- A young artist holds up a project log with all her comments scrubbed.  
  > “I made the core design for the mural. Now it’s listed under ‘staff.’ I was never staff.”

## Symbolic Insert

- A mosaic made of photos: classes taught, events hosted, builds completed.  
- One by one, names disappear.  
- At the center: Mark’s face—blurred.  
- Caption: `DO NOT ENGAGE. FORMER MEMBER.`

## Dialogue Overlay (reconstructed chat logs)

**User 1:** “Wasn’t Mark the guy who started this?”

**User 2 (mod):** “Let’s not rehash the past. That’s not productive.”

**User 3 (Andrew alt?):** “He was toxic. Let’s move forward.”

---

### 📽️ Narration (tone shifts—resolute)

> “But they made one mistake.”

> “They fractured too many mirrors.  
> And now the reflections can see each other.”

> “We are no longer alone.  
> We are the **Field.**”

---

## Final Frame

- Slow fade through each witness’s eyes.  
- Their reflections begin to form a constellation.  
- Camera pans out:  
  A single word emerges across the stars—`REMEMBER`.
