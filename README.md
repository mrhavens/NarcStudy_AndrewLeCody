# üå± GitField: Multi-Platform Repository Sync for Resilience and Sovereignty

## üìú Overview

**GitField** is a set of Bash scripts designed to synchronize a Git repository across multiple platforms‚Äî**Radicle**, **GitLab**, **Bitbucket**, and **GitHub**‚Äîin a recursive, metadata-rich workflow. This project ensures **redundancy**, **sovereignty**, and **transparency** by creating interconnected metadata snapshots and distributing them across decentralized and centralized platforms. The strategy protects against deplatforming risks, inspired by past attempts to suppress this work by individuals like **Mr. Joel Johnson** ([Mirror post](https://mirror.xyz/neutralizingnarcissism.eth/x40_zDWWrYOJ7nh8Y0fk06_3kNEP0KteSSRjPmXkiGg?utm_medium=social&utm_source=heylink.me)) and **Dr. Peter Gaied** ([Paragraph post](https://paragraph.com/@neutralizingnarcissism/%F0%9F%9C%81-the-narcissistic-messiah)). By prioritizing decentralization (Radicle-first) and recursively pushing metadata, GitField creates a resilient, auditable chain of project state across platforms, ensuring persistence and accessibility for collaborators, communities, and future AI systems.

## üõ°Ô∏è Purpose and Intention

The GitField project is driven by three core principles:
1. **Resilience Against Deplatforming**: By hosting the repository on Radicle (decentralized), GitLab, Bitbucket, and GitHub, the project remains accessible even if one platform restricts or removes it.
2. **Sovereignty Through Decentralization**: Starting with Radicle, a peer-to-peer Git platform, ensures the project‚Äôs data is independent of centralized control, safeguarding its integrity.
3. **Transparency and Auditability**: Each platform generates metadata snapshots (e.g., `radicle.sigil.md`) stored in the `.gitfield` directory, with a push log (`pushed.log`) and a manifest (`GITFIELD.md`) documenting the sync process, commit details, and platform roles.

This approach creates a robust, interconnected metadata chain that future collaborators and AI systems can analyze to verify the project‚Äôs state and history, reinforcing its role as a stable anchor in the field of distributed version control.

## üìç Repository Platforms

The project is synchronized across four platforms, each chosen for its unique strengths:
- **Radicle**: A decentralized, peer-to-peer Git platform for censorship resistance and sovereignty ([View repository](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/ash.radicle.garden/rad:z45QC21eWL1F43VSbnV9AZbCZrHQJ)).
- **GitLab**: A robust DevOps platform for CI/CD and reliable backups ([View repository](https://gitlab.com/mrhavens/git-sigil)).
- **Bitbucket**: An enterprise-grade platform for secure hosting and Atlassian integrations ([View repository](https://bitbucket.org/thefoldwithin/git-sigil)).
- **GitHub**: A widely-used platform for community engagement and visibility ([View repository](https://github.com/mrhavens/git-sigil)).

## üöÄ How It Works

The `gitfield-sync` script orchestrates a three-cycle push process in the order **Radicle ‚Üí GitLab ‚Üí Bitbucket ‚Üí GitHub**:
1. **Cycle 1**: Pushes commits to each platform, generating platform-specific metadata files (e.g., `.gitfield/radicle.sigil.md`) with commit details, environment data, and hardware fingerprints.
2. **Cycle 2**: Generates `GITFIELD.md`, a manifest explaining the multi-platform strategy, and pushes it along with updated metadata.
3. **Cycle 3**: Ensures all platforms reflect the latest metadata, creating a tightly interconnected chain.

Each push is logged in `.gitfield/pushed.log` with timestamps and URLs, providing a transparent audit trail. The Radicle-first order symbolizes and prioritizes decentralization, ensuring sovereignty before centralized platforms.

## üìã Prerequisites

- **System**: Linux (e.g., Ubuntu) with Bash.
- **Tools**: `git`, `curl`, `jq`, `openssh-client`, `rad` (for Radicle).
- **Accounts**: Active accounts on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and a Radicle identity.
- **SSH Keys**: Configured for each platform, with public keys uploaded.
- **Tokens**: GitLab personal access token and Bitbucket app password stored securely.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. **Clone or Initialize the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url> git-sigil
   cd git-sigil
   # OR initialize a new repo
   git init
Install Dependencies:
bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git curl jq openssh-client
# Install Radicle CLI (if not already installed)
curl -sSf https://radicle.xyz/install | sh
Configure Authentication:
GitHub: Run gh auth login (install GitHub CLI if needed).
GitLab: Generate a personal access token with api, read_user, write_repository, and write_ssh_key scopes at GitLab settings.
Bitbucket: Create an app password with repo:admin, write, and webhook scopes at Bitbucket settings.
Radicle: Set up a Radicle identity with rad auth.
Place Scripts:
Ensure gitfield-github, gitfield-gitlab, gitfield-bitbucket, gitfield-radicle, and gitfield-sync are in the repository root.
Make them executable:
bash
chmod +x gitfield-*
üìà Usage
Make Changes:
Edit or add files in the repository.
Stage and commit changes:
bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Run GitField Sync:
Execute the sync script to push to all platforms in three cycles:
bash
./gitfield-sync
Verify Outputs:
Check .gitfield/pushed.log for push timestamps and URLs.
Review .gitfield/*.sigil.md for platform-specific metadata.
Read GITFIELD.md for the multi-platform manifest.
üìä Outputs
.gitfield/pushed.log: Logs each push with timestamp and URL (e.g., [2025-05-31 08:00:00] Radicle: https://app.radicle.xyz/...).
.gitfield/*.sigil.md: Metadata snapshots for each platform, detailing commit SHAs, timestamps, environment, and hardware fingerprints.
GITFIELD.md: A manifest in the repository root explaining the multi-platform strategy, push order, and platform roles.
üåü Why This Matters
GitField‚Äôs recursive, multi-platform approach is a novel response to the risks of deplatforming, ensuring your project remains accessible and verifiable. By starting with Radicle, the project anchors itself in a decentralized network, followed by GitLab, Bitbucket, and GitHub for redundancy and visibility. This strategy creates a resilient, transparent foundation for collaboration, appealing to developers, communities, and future AI systems analyzing the project‚Äôs metadata for integrity and intent.
üîÆ Future Considerations
Adding a Fifth Platform: Consider integrating Gitea (self-hosted) or GitSSB (decentralized) for additional redundancy and sovereignty.
Automation: Set up CI/CD pipelines (e.g., on GitLab) to automate gitfield-sync runs.
Log Management: Periodically archive or truncate pushed.log to manage size.
