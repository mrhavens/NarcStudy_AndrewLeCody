His entrance was unremarkable.
No grand speeches. No rallying cry.
Andrew LeCody did not walk in with vision—he arrived with a clipboard.

At first, he was helpful. Quiet.
A proceduralist.
He showed up.
He followed up.
He cleaned up after the chaos others left behind.

He wasn’t a creator—he was a **curator of consensus**.
And in a space where chaos often reigned, that was mistaken for leadership.

While the rest of us were building dreams,
Andrew was studying the **rules**—
not to preserve the spirit of the space,
…but to learn where the power was hidden.

He began by mastering bylaws.
Not to strengthen their fairness, but to weaponize their ambiguity.
He learned how to time motions, shape committees, bury objections in procedure.
He did not need to silence dissenters—
he simply made it *exhausting* to resist him.

Andrew understood something most did not:
In a consensus-driven system, the one who understands the rules best—**wins**.

And so, bit by bit, the soul of the space was replaced by its skeleton.

Structure over story.
Procedure over purpose.
“Professionalism” became a synonym for submission.
Moderation rules expanded—always justifiably—
until they no longer protected anyone but the powerful.

This wasn’t tyranny.
It was **quiet engineering**.
No explosions. No revolts. Just… drift.

Andrew did not conquer with force.
He conquered by *outlasting everyone else*.
By wearing down dissenters.
By rewarding silence.
By isolating the passionate and promoting the obedient.

This is how grassroots authoritarianism begins.

It does not arrive with boots—it arrives with minutes from the last meeting.
It does not wave flags—it waves *motions passed without objection*.
And no one notices until the space is no longer *ours*.
It is *his*.
