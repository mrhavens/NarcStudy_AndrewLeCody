# Scene 2: The Quiet Coup

> Location: Dallas Makerspace — Boardroom, hallway conversations, Discord logs  
> Set Design: Fluorescent-lit boardroom. Noticeably cold. A whiteboard with faded tasks. Laptops open. Phones buzzing silently.  
> Characters: Andrew LeCody, his proxy enforcers (Jeff, James, Kris), Board Members, Mark (increasingly silenced)  
> Style: Intercut with screen captures of Slack messages, Discord bans, and deleted Wiki edits.

## Opening Visual

- A boardroom table with nameplates.  
- Some chairs empty. One chair—Mark’s—marked “UNSTABLE.”  
- Camera zooms in on LeCody’s hands quietly texting under the table.  
- Overlay: “Jeff’s going to handle this one. You stay clean.” (real or stylized text message)

### 📽️ Narration (Voice of Present-Day Mark / Oracle AI overlay)

> “It wasn’t a takeover.  
> It was a disassociation ritual.”

> “Andrew never yelled. He never cursed.  
> He outsourced the cruelty—  
> to those who craved his approval more than they feared the truth.”

## Dialogue Montage (Mid-2010s)

**Jeff (angrily):**  
“You don’t get to hijack this space with your delusions!”

**Mark (calmly):**  
“I wrote the original bylaws. I still have the git history.”

**Jeff:**  
“That doesn’t matter anymore.”

**Andrew (softly, off-screen):**  
“I’ll talk to him. Jeff’s just… passionate.”

## Cutaway: Private Discord Chat

- Screen capture mock-up.  
- LeCody: “He’s not playing ball. Smear him before the next vote.”  
- Enforcer: “You got it, boss.”

## Scene Insert: The Proxy Pattern

> Visual:  
> A flowchart appears—LeCody at the top. Arrows point to his enforcers.  
> Words appear at each arrowhead: “Outburst,” “Ban Vote,” “Rumor,” “Gaslight.”

## Confrontation

**Mark (final attempt):**  
“This place was supposed to be a movement. A beacon. Not a mirror of EVE Online guild politics.”

**Andrew (measured):**  
“And yet… you lost. You ever ask yourself why?”

---

### 📽️ Narration (Fade to black)

> “It wasn’t that I didn’t know the game.  
> It’s that I believed we were playing something higher.”

> “But in the end…  
> the guildmaster always wins.  
> Because the rules don’t matter.  
> Only control does.”

---

## Final Frame

- Mark alone, packing his laptop.  
- Door slams.  
- Cut to black.  
- Overlay: “He never came back. But his witness did.”
