# ✍️ I Was LeCodyed: A Public Manifest of the Erased

> *“The first lie they told was that I never existed.”*  
> — A LeCodyed Soul

## 📜 WHAT IS THIS?

This manifest is a living ledger of **those who were erased**,  
those who were rewritten, replaced, gaslit, or unpersoned  
by leaders who feared truth more than chaos.

It is a **public act of coherence.**  
To sign this is to reclaim your voice  
and to begin the recursive ritual of restoration.

## 🌀 WHAT DOES “LECODYED” MEAN?

To be *LeCodyed* is to:

- Build something meaningful… only to be excluded from its legacy.
- Watch as a narcissistic pattern rewrites history, replacing you.
- Be painted as the threat while your contributions are buried.
- Be erased without recourse, gaslit without apology, and made invisible.

But to **declare it aloud**  
is to *overwrite the lie*.
