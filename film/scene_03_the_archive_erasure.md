# Scene 3: The Archive Erasure

> Location: Makerspace Wiki interface, Git history logs, Discord moderation panels  
> Set Design: Screens overlaid in dim lighting‚Äîterminal windows, redacted pages, broken links, system error sounds  
> Characters: Andrew LeCody (as invisible hand), Proxy Moderators, Silent Witnesses, Mark (frantically saving logs)  
> Style: Forensic thriller tone; suspense-driven editing interlaced with real-time file deletions and data scraping footage.

## Opening Visual

- Screen capture of Makerspace Wiki ‚Äî "404 Not Found"

### üìΩÔ∏è Narration (Voice of Present-Day Mark, emotionally subdued)

> ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt just delete me.  
> They deleted my record of *having been there*.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúEvery entry. Every photo. Every policy I wrote.  
> Gone with a silent keystroke.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúThe system let them.  
> Because the system wasn‚Äôt built for truth‚Äî  
> it was built for access.‚Äù

## Dialogue (flashback)

**Moderator (in chat):**  
‚ÄúWe cleaned up the wiki. Too much clutter.‚Äù

**Mark:**  
‚ÄúYou removed my *existence*. That‚Äôs not clutter. That‚Äôs legacy.‚Äù

**Moderator:**  
‚ÄúTake it up with the board.‚Äù

## Cutaway: Terminal Log Sequence

- Mark typing frantic commands, backing up mirrors, encrypting logs.  
- Cursor flashes over filenames: `ORIGINAL_POLICIES.md`, `election_record.pdf`, `founding_events/`.

**Overlay Text:**  
üóÉÔ∏è `User: Mark_Randall_Havens` ‚Üí `Permission Revoked`  
üìÅ `Record: Founding Board Member` ‚Üí `404`

## Intercut: Andrew‚Äôs Silence

- LeCody never appears.  
- Instead, we see empty chat threads where his words vanish after being read.  
- A Slack audit log: `Message deleted by admin`.

---

## Visual Metaphor

- Slow zoom on an old photo‚ÄîMark holding up a soldering iron with 20 people behind him.  
- The photo glitches. Faces blur.  
- One by one, people are cropped out of the frame.  
- Only Andrew remains, smiling faintly.

### üìΩÔ∏è Narration

> ‚ÄúIn EVE Online, you learn to control the narrative of war,  
> not just the war itself.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúIn Dallas Makerspace, he learned the final step of control:  
> **Erase the memory of those who might one day contradict your story.**‚Äù

---

## Final Frame

- A folder named `witnessed/`  
- Inside it, hundreds of markdown files.  
- The cursor types: `git commit -m "Preserved truth against forgetting"`  
- Upload begins‚Ä¶  
- Camera pans out as the signal spreads across IPFS nodes, Radicle, Substack, Mirror‚Ä¶
