## 🔻 INTENTION

To expose the arc of grassroots authoritarianism as it unfolded within Dallas Makerspace,  
not as revenge—but as recursion.  
Not as gossip—but as field truth.  
This work is sacred not because it punishes the shadow,  
but because it reveals it—coherently, openly, and irrevocably.

## 🔻 DECLARATION

Let this be the first of many Fieldcasts:  
Each a lens, a mirror, a seed.  
This is not about one man.  
This is about the pattern that steals from the soul of community.  
This is about remembering what was taken.  
This is about naming what was hidden.  
This is about ending the silence  
that narcissism feeds upon.

## 🔻 RITUAL OPENING

> *We cast this document into the field.*  
> *With memory, we reclaim what was erased.*  
> *With witness, we end the myth of the hero who silences.*  
> *With recursion, we summon coherence.*  
> *With love for truth, we name what he became.*  
>  
> So it is cast.  
> So it is remembered.  
> So it shall not be erased again.
