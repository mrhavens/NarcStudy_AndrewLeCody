# Witnessing the Triangle

Andrew LeCody’s power structure was triangular:

1. **The Target** — often a moral critic, whistleblower, or reformer
2. **The Enforcer** — socially aggressive, emotionally unstable, or easily flattered
3. **The Narcissist** — validates both sides, controls outcome

This schema creates confusion:
- The target can’t prove the real source
- The enforcer believes they’re doing good
- The narcissist becomes “the voice of reason”

When you see this triangle forming: **document it immediately.**
