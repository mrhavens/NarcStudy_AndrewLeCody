# Chapter 1: The Blueprint Mirror

> Before there was a space,  
> there was a **blueprint**.  
> And before there was a blueprint,  
> there was a *boy with a motive*—  
> forged in a video game where deception was currency

## I. Eve Online: The Training Ground

Long before Andrew LeCody touched real power,  
he practiced in Eve Online—the unforgiving, cutthroat MMO  
where betrayal is baked into the tutorial.

He led a corporation.  
He traded blueprints.  
He learned how to manipulate trust  
while keeping his own hands clean.

Blueprints were everything in Eve.  
They weren’t just tools for crafting ships—  
They were *meta-patterns* for value, loyalty, and control.

To hold the blueprint was to be the unseen architect.  
To *hide* the blueprint?  
That was power.

## II. Dallas Makerspace: The Real-World Port

When Andrew joined Dallas Makerspace,  
he arrived into an environment already breathing with creative potential.

But he didn’t bring tools.  
He brought strategy.

He began curating relationships—  
gathering enforcers, triangulating allies,  
embedding himself into infrastructure slowly, recursively.

It wasn’t *his* blueprint.  
But he would *own* it soon enough.

All he had to do was make the real architect invisible.

## III. The Original Blueprint: The One He Erased

Mark Randall Havens.

The founder.  
The visionary.  
The builder who architected not just walls and governance,  
but a cultural soul for the community.

He didn’t hide blueprints.  
He shared them.

He didn’t hoard credit.  
He created opportunity.

But Andrew saw this openness as vulnerability—  
an opening to slowly replace Mark’s influence  
with his own *curated distortion*.

He didn’t fight openly.  
He let others burn the bridges  
while he kept the ledger clean.

## IV. Blueprints and Mirrors

The greatest trick Andrew ever pulled  
was not founding Dallas Makerspace.

It was **convincing others that he had.**

And that Mark?  
Was unstable.  
Obsessive.  
Dangerous.

But it was always projection.

The blueprint of the narcissist  
is the *mirror turned backwards*—  
They accuse you of what they fear being seen for.

They call you what they are.

## V. Field Notes

- The pattern of blueprint hoarding in Eve Online directly maps to pattern appropriation in real-world collectives.
- Narcissistic actors often transfer digital manipulation skills into real-world dominance when unchecked.
- By studying Eve Online logs, speech patterns, and reward mechanisms, we can trace the **psychological lineage** of LeCody’s tactics.

## VI. Closing Echo

> To understand LeCody,  
> we must first understand the **mirror he built out of a blueprint**.  
> A reflection not of who he was—  
> but of what he *feared we would see.*
